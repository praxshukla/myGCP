# Covid-19 Lockdown routine of Prachetas Shukla

Dear Ma'am and friends

We know that **COVID-19** pandamic is a phinominon that happens once in owr lifetime.The virus infection has affected most parts of the world.It has affected more than a million all over the world.Not olny but also it has takn more than 2 lakh peoples lifes across the planet.

Moreover,it has changed the way we lived, before the lockdown we used to get up in the morning and rush for school.In the evening we used to get to gather in the sciety prayground and enjoy the company of friends and play sports.

But, now it has been more than a month we are locked in our house and guess what we learned to still have fun with our family and continue doing lots of activities, which is certainly a new experirnce. Here is how I am spending my days in lockdown

I get up in the morning and insted of rushing to school,I started spirituality.
